# <p align="center">üê° Pufferfish üê°</p>

Pufferfish is an alternative syntax for [Jello](https://github.com/codereport/jello)
/ ü™º [Jellyfish](https://github.com/codereport/jellyfish) ü™º

Jello/Jellyfish is based on the idea that we an build up arbitrary functions by composing builtins (i.e. `sort`, `head`) with just two variadic functions
```c++
is_unary_invocable auto F‚ÇÅ(is_invocable auto ...fns)
is_binary_invocable auto F‚ÇÇ(is_invocable auto ...fns)
```
For example:
```
F‚ÇÅ(F‚ÇÅ(F‚ÇÅ(F‚ÇÅ(tail sort) take 2) pair head) F‚ÇÅ(flat sum))
```

We can make calls to `F‚ÇÅ` and `F‚ÇÇ` implicit by using parentheses `()` and curly braces `{}` to disambiguate whether we are calling `F‚ÇÅ` or `F‚ÇÇ` respectively

```
((((tail sort) take 2) pair head) (flat sum))
```
Closing parentheses (`)` and `}`) at the end of the scope are unnecessary to disambiguate the syntax.
We can replace the corresponding opening parenthesis with `\` and `|` respectively and omit the closing parenthesis.

```
\ (((tail sort) take 2) pair head) \ flat sum
```

Opening parentheses (`(` and `{`) at the start of the scope are again unnecessary to disambiguate the syntax.
We can replace the corresponding closing parenthesis with `.` and `:` respectively and omit the opening parenthesis.

```
\ tail sort . take 2 . pair head . \ flat sum
```

In fact our `F‚ÇÅ` and `F‚ÇÇ` only take at most three arguments. Only when we all applying `F‚ÇÅ` and `F‚ÇÇ` to less than three arguments is it necessary to make `.` and `:` explicit.
We can omit `.` and `:` when we have exactly three arguments:
```
\ tail sort . take 2 pair head \ flat sum
```

## `F‚ÇÅ` and `F‚ÇÇ`

`F‚ÇÅ` and `F‚ÇÇ` are solely determined by the arity of their arguments.
They can be described by the following tables
