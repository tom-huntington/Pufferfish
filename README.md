# <p align="center">üê° Pufferfish üê°</p>

Pufferfish is an alternative syntax for [Jello](https://github.com/codereport/jello)
/ ü™º [Jellyfish](https://github.com/codereport/jellyfish) ü™º

Jello/Jellyfish is based on the idea that we an build up arbitrary functions by composing builtins (i.e. `sort`, `head`) with two variadic functions.
```c++
is_unary_invocable auto F‚ÇÅ(is_invocable auto ...fns)
is_binary_invocable auto F‚ÇÇ(is_invocable auto ...fns)
```
For example, consider the following [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/contest/biweekly-contest-122/problems/divide-an-array-into-subarrays-with-minimum-cost-i/) solution:
```
F‚ÇÅ(F‚ÇÅ(F‚ÇÅ(F‚ÇÅ(tail sort) take 2) pair head) F‚ÇÅ(flat sum))
```

We can make calls to `F‚ÇÅ` and `F‚ÇÇ` implicit by using parentheses `()` and curly braces `{}` to disambiguate whether we are calling `F‚ÇÅ` or `F‚ÇÇ` respectively

```
((((tail sort) take 2) pair head) (flat sum))
```
Closing parentheses, `)` and `}`, at the end of the scope are unnecessary to disambiguate the syntax.
We can replace the corresponding opening parenthesis with `\` and `|` respectively and omit the closing parenthesis.

```
\ (((tail sort) take 2) pair head) \ flat sum
```

Opening parentheses, `(` and `{`, at the start of the scope are again unnecessary to disambiguate the syntax.
We can replace the corresponding closing parenthesis with `.` and `:` respectively and omit the opening parenthesis.

```
\ tail sort . take 2 . pair head . \ flat sum
```

In fact our `F‚ÇÅ` and `F‚ÇÇ` only take at most three arguments. Only when we all applying `F‚ÇÅ` and `F‚ÇÇ` to less than three arguments is it necessary to make `.` and `:` explicit.
We can omit `.` and `:` when we have exactly three arguments:
```
\ tail sort . take 2 pair head \ flat sum
```

To help you read the code, pufferfish will print the combinator tree:
```
tail sort take 2 pair head flat sum

        ‚ï∞‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ïØ      ‚îÇ

                 B
```

## Definition of `F‚ÇÅ` and `F‚ÇÇ`

`F‚ÇÅ` and `F‚ÇÇ` are solely determined by the arity of their arguments.
They can be described by the following tables for `F‚ÇÅ` and `F‚ÇÇ` respectively.

| Arities | Combinator | Definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (1, 2, 1) |  Œ¶  | `fn Œ¶(f,g,h) = x -> g(f(x),h(x))` |
| (1, 2) |  Œ£  |  `fn Œ£(f,g) = x -> g(x,f(x))` |
| (1, 1) |  B  |`fn b(f,g) = x -> g(f(x))` |
| (2, 1) |  S  | `fn s(f,g) = x -> f(g(x),x)` |
| (2,) |  W  | `fn w(f) = x -> f(x,x)` |


| Arities | Combinator | Definition |
| --- | --- | -- |
| (2, 2, 2)  |  Œ¶‚ÇÅ | `fn Œ¶‚ÇÅ(f,g,h) = x,y -> g(f(x,y),h(x,y))` |
| (2, 2) |  Œµ | `fn Œµ(f,g) = x,y -> g(f(x,y), y)` |
| (1, 2, 1) |  D‚ÇÇ | `fn d‚ÇÇ(f,g,h) = x,y -> f(g(x),h(y))` |
| (2, 1) |  B‚ÇÅ |`fn b‚ÇÅ(f,g) = x,y -> g(f(x,y))` |
| (1, 2, 2) |  Œ¶.‚ÇÇ | `fn Œ¶.‚ÇÇ(f,g,h) = x,y -> g(f(x),h(x,y))` |
| (1, 2) |  Œî |  `fn Œî(f,g) = x,y -> f(g(x),y)` |
| (1, 1) |  B.‚ÇÉ | `fn (f,g) = x,y -> g(f(x))` |



### Other higher order functions
Jelly also has explicit higher order functions. Pufferfish requires you to specify the arity of the result by whether you use braces `{}` or parenthese `()` at the call site i.e. `hof_name(func1 func2)` for a monadic result.
